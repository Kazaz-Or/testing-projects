// Spies are good for monitoring functions - such as tracking logs, check if a function is being called, etc.
// But there are some use cases where using spies can go wrong, note this example - the test will pass, but will fail on the 2nd attempt because test.txt will be already exist and weâ€™ll get an exception.

//      Error: EEXIST: file already exists, open './data/test.txt'

// I assume there are ways to deal with that, but you should be aware that spies are not the best option in such cases. Or to be more accurate, spies are not good at block any side effects. In such cases it is more logical to use Stubs.
