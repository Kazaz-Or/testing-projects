# Learning Mocking Node JS with Sinon

For the sake of learning, this "project" was created to learn how to mock Node JS using Sinon.
Libraries used: Sinon, Mocha, Chai, and proxyquire.

The sample application that is being tested, is taken from a PluralSight course, [Mocking Node.js with Sinon 8](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mocking-nodejs-sinon/table-of-contents)

## Sinon Features covered:

* Spies
* Stubs
* Fakes
* Mocks for Isolation of code
* Async functions and promises (promises, callbacks)

To run the tests, simply run:
```bash
npm test
```
