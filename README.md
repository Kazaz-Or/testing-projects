- [Rest API Automation Tests Framework](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/RestAPIAutomationFW): Docker & Pytest as a testing framework (also some basic hands on with openapi)
- [Testing Spreadsheet](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/TestingSpreadsheet): openpyxl
- [Basic Unit Tests Framework](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/UnitTestFrameWork): unittest

- [Rest API Automation Testing for a Wordpress webapp](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/eCommerceRestAPITesting): Pytest as a testing framework, Docker and MySQL for some manual database tests.
- [Automation Testing a Django App](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/DjangoApp-Automation): Pytest as a testing framework using two testing method - pytest-django and a more "generic" api testing with requests library.
- [Performance Testing with Locust](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/PerformanceTestingWithLocust): Load testing using Locust, while debugging and visualization for analysis purposes is done with Influx DB & Grafana
- [Rest API Testing with Cypress](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/APITestingUsingCypress): API testing using Cypress for a REST API Server written with express framework.
- [Visual Testing with Cypress & Happo JS](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects/tree/develop/VisualTestingWithCypress): Testing visual aspects of a web application using cypress & happo js.
- [Unit test with Jest & Typescript on Node/React sample apps](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/testing-projects/tree/develop/TypeScriptUnitTestsWithJest): The applications written with Typescript wasn't the focus of this project, the goal was to learn Jest features for unit testing with NodeJS/React Typescript applications.
- [Mocking NodeJS Using Sinon](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/testing-projects/tree/develop/MockingNodeJSWithSinon): For the sake of learning, this "project" was created to learn how to mock Node JS using Sinon.
