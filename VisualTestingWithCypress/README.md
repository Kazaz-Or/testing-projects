This small "project" was created by using a tutorial about visual testing which help us compare different states and resolution of a web application.

In this case i used ultimateqa.com which was the tutorial instructor website.

For this testing i used Cypress and Happo JS which provides you the ability to perform such kind of testing, while helping ignore "false alarms" in cases like dynamic elements/content.

How to run:

``
npm run test:visual
``
